        <h1>Happy Valentines Day!</h1>
        <h3>by your soon to be boyfriend</h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Happy Valentine's Day! I'm delighted that we've come this far with our feelings for each other. 
            Regardless of the ups and downs we've experienced, I'm genuinely happy that we're still together. 
            I share the same sentiments as you – it's quite surprising that we both didn't expect to develop feelings for each other. 
            Moreover, this marks my first time celebrating Valentine's Day with someone romantically, and I'm truly glad it's with you.
        </p>

            I never anticipated something like this happening in my life. Having you by my side is enjoyable; 
            you're a very funny person with numerous quirky yet fun ideas. Your kindness stands out, 
            and despite any side-eye you may give me, you consistently help people in need, provided the situation makes sense, 
            and you persist until it's no longer feasible. Your generosity extends not only to people but also to adorable 
            little animals.
        </p>

        <p>
        It warms my heart to see you chasing after a dog or enthusiastically exclaiming, "There's a cat!" or "There's a dog!" 
            You are considerate, polite, and respectful, possessing manners, an understanding of social cues, and a knack for 
            recognizing inconveniences. You genuinely are a wonderful person who knows when to stop and respects boundaries.
        </p>

        <p>
        Physically, you are incredibly attractive. When I say very, I mean VERY beautiful. Your face is perfection, and you 
            manage to be both adorable and pretty simultaneously. Your hair, eyes, ears, nose, lips, teeth – everything 
            about you is perfect. Coupled with your fantastic personality, you only enhance your perfection. I might sound repetitive, 
            but I can't help stating that you're perfect because you truly are. I feel like I'm going crazy (I need you badly).
        </p>

        <p>
        Sometimes, when I look at things, I'm reminded of you. Stars, for instance, appear small from a distance, much like 
            how people may not understand your wonderful qualities until they get closer. Fire, too, reminds me of you – when fueled,
             it grows larger, and when confronted with nonsense, you understandably get upset. It may sound cheesy, but saying
             I'm going crazy is an understatement.

        <p>
        You are present in almost all of my memorable moments in life, giving me a reason to be happy. If there are indeed other 
            universes, I hope that each version of me is fortunate enough to encounter and spend time with you. The idea of us being 
            in love with each other in every universe is something I cherish. I never imagined I would have the honor of having you by 
            my side. I really, really, really, really love you, and I hope you share the same feelings.
        </p>

        <p>
        Sometimes, I'm not sure how to comfort or help you, and I'm sorry for that. I'm not great at dealing with emotions, and 
            giving or receiving comfort is not my strong suit. I hope you can understand and be patient with me as I try to figure it
            out. If there's something specific you'd like or need, just let me know so I can be better for you.
        </p>

        You make me feel safe, and I appreciate that. Whenever we hug, my chest feels lighter somehow. I don't know how to explain 
            it, but it's truly a reassuring and warm feeling. I just know that I'll only experience this feeling with you. When we're 
            together, your smile and laughter really lift my spirits. It's very cute and uplifting to see you genuinely happy with me.
            </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 50px;">You don't have to worry about me falling out of love or finding someone else- since that will never happen. I've experienced
            a lot with you and shared so many memories that I really won't forget. I'm sure I'll cry river when you leave so please 
            don't. We've been through so much and it's just the start of everything. I love you so much.
        </p>

        You don't piss me off or make me angry. Whenever we're not agreeing or in the same side I always do my best to stay calm and 
            not let anger take over me. I do blurt out words that shouldn't be said, but really it's just because I'm panicking. I can't
             bring myself to be mad at you or continue going emo just because I love you and I really can't bear hearing you cry that 
             loudly again. (Not in a mean way, just saying that I don't want you to cry like that so I'm trying my best not to make you 
             cry)
        </p>

         <p> 
        I love it when we're laughing together. When you make funny faces or try to do something in attempt to make me laugh, I really
             can't resist. I also have fun tickling you or playing with your stomach just to hear the sounds you make, from lewd sounds to
              sounds of laughter. To others we might seem and sound crazy, which is true, but it just makes me happy to see us ignoring 
              the world only focusing on each other. As time passes this, hopefully, will grow.
        </p>

         <p> 
        I aspire to be a person with whom you can feel comfortable, happy, and safe. I apologize for the times when I couldn't be 
            there for you or when you wanted to be with me, but I couldn't. I acknowledge my shortcomings in making you happy, and to 
            compensate, I will exert all my effort into becoming the man you desire. I hope that one day we'll be together, forever.
        </p>

        I hope you like the gifts- I know they're just small, but still, I find them cute. The charms, although small really remind 
            me of us. Electro for you cause you're scary when you're mad and Anemo for me since bisag asa rako ma abot. I find the 
            necklace very cute and I like how they form a heart when you actually put them together. The flower, I hope looks cute at 
            the end- I really don't know how to make it, so I'll leave it to my beautiful, amazing, one of a kind girlfriend! And 
            lastly the bouquet, I really want to give you actual flower bouquet, but it's expensive for me and I've used my money on 
            random stuff already.

         <p>     
        To end it all, I'd like to say that I'm sorry that this is rushed since really this idea was so last minute and I have to 
            learn as I go. I could  yap more about us, but I'm in a hurry since I have to do Math performance task. That was all I 
            hope you enjoy this day and the little gifts I've given, I'm sorry I couldn't do more. I love you and Happy Valentines!
